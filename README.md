Welcome to GSCF Bids Tracker. A simple CRUD single page application used to keep track of bids for a construction company.

The idea of this app started as I moved from a accounting manager position to project engineer. One of my daily tasks was to keep track of bids and as well as reporting status on change order logs to project managers, billing department, and the CEO. I decided to use my personal time to make my day job more convienent by learning how to develop a web based application for easy access for my coworkers. Instead of them coming to ask me or if I'm not present, they have the ease of just accessing the application online. I used React to create the page and firebase to store the data.

To get started please create an account and play around with the UI.
